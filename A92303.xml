            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

And that this also is Gods purpose at this time it will evidently appear to any that hath observed the Lords usuall manner of working in former ages; for it is likely he hath suffered his Church and common wealth to decline, his people to be wearied with so many taxes and heavy oppressions for many yeers together to move and stir them up, like Israel in Egypt, to shake off their tirannicall yokes, and to lay hold on the first opportunity and lawfull means of their long desired freedome whereas if the Church and common wealth had continued in their perscribed formes and rules neither spiritualty nor lalty could ever have thought; much lesse have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken to involve themselves in so difficult a Laborinth as this hath been. And whereas the aspiring Clergie would have by little and little imagined themselves to have been some ptety deities long ere now; if by chance look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down their black and earthy feet had not appeared below their white robes to male content (with the Swan) their overweaved conceits; and to frustrate their owne vaine and emptie fantasies: therefore that they might still

               </label> conquer at the first strroke, nor expect to have the prize before we have runne the course. The children of Israel were sure of victorie in their peregri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to Canaan; and yet they were forced to strive till they got possessions let us herein exercise our faith, and knit the beginning, progresse and end to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and we shall soon see, that he that begun this worke will in good time bring it to perfection: for where Christ begins to rule, he rules for ever; of his kingdome there is no end. When the fuell strives with the fire the heel kicks a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the prick; and when the creature advanceth himself against his Creator it is easie to inferre the conquest. What if Antichrist doth march furiously, and his supports use their utmost endevours and parts to trample upon truth and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety?
<pb facs="tcp:153510:4"/>they can extinguish their light no more then the morning clonds can doe the sunnes, which by little and little expells their gatherings, and wastes their packs, that in an iustant none of them are to be seene. Can we think that he which threw the angels out of heaven, will suffer mortalls to run a contrary course without either curbe or bridle, and to prevail against heavenly pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers? was there ever any fierce against God and prospered? surely the rage of man contrary to his owne intendment shall turn to the praise of Christ, and furtherance of that work which God in his appointed time hath proposed to himself,

As for our own Papists, they now shew of what spirit they are; They have got their heads so much into the winde that they cannot be turned by a gentle hand, whose insolencies and provocations re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound so high, that any finger may point at the mark of their hearts by the levell of their tongues, so that we need not doubt but their judgements also will fall upon them, so soon as their treacheries are grown to full maturity, yet these men had they guided themselves modestly, and tempered themselves civilly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all either allied kinsmen, or intimately friendly and familiar with either one or other, how ha<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               </label> in giving to these pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ministers of the state the best interpretation that their actions will beare; that they invert all their honest actions, and traduce and reproach their inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent persons? but it is no matter, for it was Christs and Iohns lot, austere Iohn hath a devill, sociable Christ is a wine bibber, &amp;c. Whereas the holinesse of the one should have procured reverence, and the sociablenesse of the other beene rewarded with love; but it is the lot of them and all christians, the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple is not above his Master.
